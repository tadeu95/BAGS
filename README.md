2. Optionally you can download and install [RStudio.](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

3. Open RGui or Rstudio and run this line of code to install the necessary packages:
```
install.packages(c("seqRFLP","bold","data.table","worms","stringr","readr","fingerprint","dplyr","ggplot2","shiny","shinyWidgets","snakecase"))
```
4. Load the "shiny" package by running:
```
library(shiny)
```
5. Run the app from GitHub:
```
runGitHub("BAGS", "tadeu95")
```

### Running BAGS by manually downloading the app file to your computer:

2. Optionally you can download and install [RStudio.](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

3. Open RGui or Rstudio and install the necessary packages:
```
install.packages(c("seqRFLP","bold","data.table","worms","stringr","readr","fingerprint","dplyr","ggplot2","shiny","shinyWidgets","snakecase"))
```
4. Go to "File" on the top left corner, click "Open file" / "Open script" and choose the "app" file.

5. In the top right corner of the opened app script file, click "run app" if you're on RStudio. Another alternative is to run the script line by line using ctrl+ENTER for each chunk of code. If you're on RGui, select all the text in the script file (Ctrl+A) then click the right button of the mouse and choose "Run line or selection" (Ctrl+R).

6. After running the script, a window with the app will pop up, and you can click "open in browser" to run the app in your default browser if you're on RStudio. 
If you're on RGui, the app will automatically open in your default browser.
